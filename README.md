# pytorch_zoo
pytorch implementations of various kinds of famous deep learnig models and algorithms

### Used dataset: cifar-10
due to the lack of high performance NVIDIA video card, the size of models could be small

### The implemented models:
- LeNet
- AlexNet (did not implement the LRN layer)
- ResNet
